# RAG Evaluation Strategies with LLM-Based Evaluators

This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using custom evaluator modules built with LLMs.

The evaluation workflow helps assess **factual correctness**, **retrieval relevance**, and **hallucination detection** by analyzing generated answers against retrieved documents and structured explanations.

---

## What It Does

* Extracts factual claims or key points from LLM-generated responses.
* Evaluates each fact for alignment with source documents using a judgment system (✅ Yes / ❌ No / 🤔 Unclear).
* Computes a final score based on the fraction of correct (Yes) facts.
* Provides explanations for incorrect or ambiguous evaluations.

This enables fine-grained inspection of answer quality, especially in cases where classical metrics (like BLEU or ROUGE) fall short.

---

## 🧰 Key Features

* Uses **LLM-as-a-judge** style evaluators.
* Can be integrated into multi-agent or human-in-the-loop workflows.
* Suitable for evaluating:

  * Groundedness of answers.
  * Effectiveness of reranking or query expansion techniques.
  * Tradeoffs between answer completeness vs. accuracy.

---

## 🔧 Setup

Make sure you have the following installed in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Recommended models:

* `gpt-4` / `gpt-4o` (for higher accuracy in evaluation)
* Groq or OpenAI clients for LLM inference

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Run `evaluators.ipynb` after generating RAG answers from your pipeline.
2. Provide:

   * The original user query
   * The generated answer
   * The supporting context retrieved
3. The notebook will:

   * Extract factual statements from the answer
   * Check those facts against the context
   * Return a score and detailed justification

---

## 📈 Use Case Scenarios

* Benchmark different RAG configurations (e.g., with/without reranking)
* Detect hallucinated or ungrounded content
* Compare embedding models, retrieval strategies, or context expansion logic
* Build feedback loops for retraining or editing agents

---

## 📌 Notes

This evaluator is modular and can be extended with:

* Custom prompts for other dimensions (e.g., tone, completeness, harmfulness)
* External label datasets for supervised fine-tuning
* Automated scoring dashboards
